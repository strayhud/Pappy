    <meta name="description" content="Introduction to New Relic® Simple. Powerful. On-demand Application Management What is RPM? RPM™ is the first Application Performance Management solution deployed as SaaS It provides real-time, transaction-level visibility inside production web applications Supports Ruby, Java, .NET, and PHP applications It provides 24x7 monitoring and alerting combined with deep code-level diagnostics, and long term performance improvement tools. Its designed to monitor applications running in either highly dynamic (cloud) or dedicated infrastructures  Top reasons customers use RPM Application not performing as expected in production Pre-deployment testing of apps in cloud, datacenter, or hybrid environments Need to establish and measure SLAs with end users, partners, 3rd party services Exec management/line of business owners want to tie business metrics with app performance Cost of app ownership is too high; need to decrease downtime, reduce MTTR (mean time to repair/remediate), eliminate brand damage due to poor performance Ongoing optimization/maintenance – ensure long term app health Who uses RPM?    How RPM Works App Team New Relic Service Https Https Applications Secure, reliable service No private user data View app performance from anywhere Benefits of SaaS Speed — RPM takes two minutes to fully deploy Power — Monitoring, troubleshooting, tuning and planning for Java, Ruby or JRuby apps Simplicity — No configuration or consulting needed Low TCO — No servers, no storage, no annual maintenance, no seat licenses Value — Starts as low as $50/month/server (or $.10 per hour in our On-demand Plan) Flexibility — Manage apps in the cloud or the datacenter (Over 1,000 cloud customers today) What RPM Monitors            Web Transactions (i.e. Login, Search, Checkout) Response Time (time it takes a txn to execute) Throughput (# of txn’s processed per/min) Sample Transaction Excellent Good Fair  Poor    Unacceptable How Apdex Works How RPM is Packaged     Thread Profiler (JAVA) Detailed profile of a running JVM  Capacity Analysis (RAILS) Shows if you have enough application instances running to handle load...or to many. BRONZE Troubleshooting &amp; Problem Diagnosis GOLD Performance Tuning &amp; Optimization SILVER Monitoring Demo Reference Slides Home Page Birds-eye view of the health of all of your applications. Logical  Application Definitions  Status of key performance  metrics  Recent  Events such as notes, deployments, alerts, and more    Clicking ‘Edit Alerts’ lets you set thresholds for alerts ** Apdex is currently set in the newrelic.yml file  Application Overview Graphs showing Apdex and  Throughput over time.

Response Time on Y axis Load on X Axis Colored dots show time of  day when  measurements were aggregated Can be viewed from RT, DB, or CPU perspective     Deployment History Summarizes performance metrics after each deployment or key event. Each time a deployment is made RPM can rollup and summarize application performance at that time. Clicking on a deployment lets you view before/after trends of key metrics.     SLA Reports Show how well your application is meeting its performance goals. # Requests processed each week or month Apdex details for each period Graph of apdex score    Availability Monitoring Configuration Double-click to edit Availability Report Double-click to edit Q&amp;A"/>
